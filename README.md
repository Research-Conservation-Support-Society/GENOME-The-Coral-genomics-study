# GENOME-The-Coral-genomics-study
This is a documentation of the working of the project: GENOME-wide Exploration for Novel Organismal Markers to Enhance coral taxonomy and conservation in Kenya [(The Coral Genomics Study).](https://coralgenomics.recourse.co.ke/)

## Introduction #
The Corals Genomics Study project seeks to advance to knowledge in coral evolution, biodiversity and resilience through genomics. Our main aim is to resolve confounding coral species boundaries and provide actionable knowledge for in field conservation.

The project is multidisciplinary in nature and therefore involves experts from diverse backgrounds including;
Our team encompasses a diverse array of skillsets: bioinformatics, molecular biology, marine ecology, zoology, and conservation.

By combining genomics and coral taxonomy, we are providing actionable knowledge that will help policy makers, scientists and conservationists to:

* Recognise and prioritise the conservation of unique coral lineages.
* Make evidence-based decisions on location and scope of marine protected areas.
* Run restoration projects with genetically diverse and resilient corals.

## Approach
Leverage low cost whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) and triple enzyme restriction associated DNA sequencing (3RADSeq) to generate high quality genomic data. These datasets will be used to infer phylogenetic relationships and accurately delineate the boundaries of coral species.

This will be done through the following objectives:

## Objectives
1. Delimit and validate Kenyan coral species
2. Identify and map QTLs predictive of species identity
3. Develop and optimise field-ready PCR protocols
4. Estimate genetic diversity
5. Capacity building and partner engagement
