## 3. Sample Processing

### 3.1 Tissue Preparation

1. Rinse each coral tissue sample briefly with **distilled water** to remove mucus and excess ethanol.  
2. Weigh approximately **0.02 g** of tissue.  
3. Transfer the weighed tissue into a **2 mL microcentrifuge tube**.

## 4. DNA Extraction Procedure (TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit)

### 4.1 Sample Preparation for Tissue

1. Add **200 µL Buffer GA** to the tube containing ~0.02 g tissue.  
2. *(Optional)* If RNA-free DNA is required,add **4 µL RNase A (100 mg/mL)**, vortex for 15 seconds, and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.

---

### 4.2 Lysis

1. Add **20 µL Proteinase K** and mix thoroughly.  
2. Incubate at **56°C** until the tissue is completely lysed.  
   - Typical lysis time: **1–3 hours**, depending on tissue density.  
   - Invert samples **2–3 times every hour** or place on a shaking water bath.  

---

### 4.3 Enhanced Lysis and Heat Treatment

1. Add **200 µL Buffer GB** to the lysed sample.  
2. Mix thoroughly by vortexing.  
3. Incubate at **70°C for 10 minutes**.  
4. Briefly centrifuge to collect condensation from the tube lid.  
   - Note: White precipitate may appear when adding Buffer GB; this dissolves during the 70°C incubation.

---

### 4.4 DNA Binding

1. Add **200 µL ethanol (96–100%)** and mix thoroughly for **15 seconds**.  
2. Briefly centrifuge the tube to collect liquid from the lid.  
3. Transfer the mixture to a **Spin Column CB3** placed in a 2 mL Collection Tube.  
4. Centrifuge at **12,000 rpm (~13,400 × g) for 30 seconds**.  
5. Discard the flow-through and return the spin column to the collection tube.

---

### 4.5 Washing Steps

#### **Wash 1**
1. Add **500 µL Buffer GD** (ethanol-added).  
2. Centrifuge at **12,000 rpm for 30 seconds**.  
3. Discard flow-through.

#### **Wash 2**
1. Add **600 µL Buffer PW** (ethanol-added).  
2. Centrifuge at **12,000 rpm for 30 seconds**.  
3. Discard flow-through and return the spin column to the collection tube.

#### **Repeat Wash 2**
1. Add another **600 µL Buffer PW**.  
2. Centrifuge at **12,000 rpm for 30 seconds**.  
3. Discard flow-through.

---

### 4.6 Membrane Drying

1. Centrifuge the spin column at **12,000 rpm for 2 minutes** to fully dry the membrane.  
   - Residual ethanol may interfere with downstream applications if not fully removed.

---

### 4.7 DNA Elution

1. Place the spin column into a clean **1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube**.  
2. Add **50–200 µL Buffer TE** directly to the membrane (50 µL for high concentration, 200 µL for higher yield).  
3. Incubate at **room temperature for 2–5 minutes**.  
4. Centrifuge at **12,000 rpm for 2 minutes** to elute DNA.  
5. Store eluted DNA at **–20°C** or proceed to quality assessment.

---

## 5. DNA Quality Assessment

### 5.1 Quantification

- Measure DNA concentration and purity using a **Nanodrop spectrophotometer**.  
- Record **A260/280** and **A260/230** ratios.

### 5.2 Integrity Check

- Run a **2% agarose gel** to assess DNA integrity and fragmentation.

---

## 6. Notes & Quality Assurance

- Ensure complete lysis before proceeding to avoid low yield.  
- White precipitates during Buffer GB addition are normal and dissolve at 70°C.  
- Ethanol must be added to Buffer GD and Buffer PW before first use.  
- Ensure the membrane is completely dry before elution.  
- Avoid transferring precipitates into the spin column.
