## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the standardised procedure for collecting coral tissue samples for genomic analysis while ensuring minimal damage to coral colonies and preventing cross-contamination.

---

## 2. Sampling Sites and Timeline

Sampling will be conducted at the following sites:

- **Kikuyu House**
- **Pilli Pipa**
- **Firefly**

**Sampling window:** March  
**Preferred time:** Morning to mid-morning during **low tide**.

---

## 3. Target Populations and Species

Samples will be collected from different reef populations:

- **Nursery**
- **Artificial Reef**
- **Natural Reef**

**Target species:**

- *Acropora formosa*
- *Acropora tenuis*
- *...*

### Sample Summary Table

| Population      | Species A | Species B | Total |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| Site 1        | 16         | 6         | 23     |
| Site 2 | 18         | 9         | 27     |
| Site 3    | 16         | 9         | 25     |
| **Total**       | **50**     | **25**    | **75** |

## 4. Required Equipment and Materials

- Coral cutters and pliers  
- Bleach solution (for tool sterilisation)  
- 15 mL Falcon tubes  
- Absolute ethanol (≥95%)  
- Waterproof labels or pre-labelled tubes  
- Ice box or cooler with ice packs  
- Field notebook or digital metadata log  

---

## 5. Sampling Procedure

### 5.1 Preparation

1. Pre-label 15 mL Falcon tubes with:
   - Population  
   - Species  
   - Structure (Nursery / Artificial Reef, if applicable)  
   - Position reference  
   - Sample ID  
2. Prepare an ice box with frozen packs for sample preservation.

---

### 5.2 Collecting Coral Fragments

1. Identify healthy coral colonies of the target species.  
2. Using sterile cutters or pliers, remove approximately **3 cm³** of coral tissue.  
3. Collect samples carefully to minimise colony damage.

---

### 5.3 Preventing Cross-Contamination

1. Rinse tools after each collection event.  
2. Sterilise cutters/pliers in **bleach solution** between samples.  
3. Rinse thoroughly to remove bleach residues before reuse.

---

### 5.4 Sample Preservation

1. Immediately place each coral fragment into the labelled Falcon tube containing **absolute ethanol**.  
2. Ensure the fragment is fully submerged.  
3. Confirm correct and complete tube labelling.

---

### 5.5 Transport and Storage

1. Store tubes vertically in the ice box immediately after collection.  
2. Transport samples to **PUBReC** within **24 hours** of collection.  
3. Maintain samples on ice throughout transport.  
4. Store appropriately upon arrival until DNA extraction.

---

## 6. Notes & Quality Assurance

- Rapid immersion in ethanol and cold storage are essential for DNA preservation.  
- Accurate labelling ensures data traceability and prevents metadata errors.  
- Bleach sterilisation between samples is mandatory to prevent cross-contamination.
