# Protocols for the Coral Genomics Study

This folder contains standardized laboratory protocols used in the project:

**GENOME-wide Exploration for Novel Organismal Markers to Enhance Coral Taxonomy and Conservation in Kenya**

These protocols ensure reproducibility, transparency, and consistency across field sampling, DNA extraction, and 3RAD library preparation workflows.

---

## Included Protocol Files

- **SAMPLING_PROTOCOL.md**  
  Standard operating procedure for field collection of coral tissue samples, including contamination control, preservation, and metadata requirements.

- **DNA_EXTRACTION_PROTOCOL.md**  
  Sample processing and genomic DNA extraction workflow using the **TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (TIANGEN)**.

- **3RAD_LIBRARY_PREPARATION_PROTOCOL.md**  
  Complete laboratory workflow for generating 3RAD sequencing libraries following Bayona-Vásquez et al. (2019).

---

## How to Use These Protocols

1. **Review the relevant protocol before starting any workflow.**  
   Each protocol includes required materials, sequential steps, quality control requirements, and version history.

2. **Follow PUBReC laboratory safety standards** and ethical guidelines for sample handling and marine organism research.

3. **Document deviations or optimizations**:  
   - Update the Version Control table inside the protocol file.  
   - Commit the updated file with a clear Git message describing the change.

4. **Use the metadata templates provided in `/metadata/`( to be uploaded soon)**  
   to log sample IDs, locations, extraction batches, and library prep information.
