** Species Delimitation Decision Tree (lcWGS + RADseq Framework)

**Step 1 — Do nuclear phylogenies (UCEs + exons) form a strong monophyletic clade?**
-	Build UCE tree
-	Build exon tree
-	Check if the same individuals cluster together

**YES**: Stable monophyletic cluster → Go to Step 2

**NO**: Cannot be considered a species yet
→ Investigate misidentification, contamination, cryptic structure, or hybridization.
Why this matters?
Nuclear data have high resolution and reflect species boundaries more accurately than mtDNA in corals.

**Step 2 — Do mitochondrial genomes support the same clade?**
(Or at least do not contradict it strongly.)

**YES:** Mitochondrial signal concordant → Go to Step 3

**NO:** Mitochondrial discordance
→ Nuclear data still take precedence (common in corals), but flag for further review.
Why this matters?
Coral mtDNA evolves slowly and can produce false negatives, but strong disagreement may indicate recent hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting.

**Step 3 — Are there diagnostic genetic differences?**

Check for:
-	Fixed SNPs
-	Species-specific haplotypes
-	Unique alleles
-	Clear barcode gaps (within-group vs between-group divergence)

**YES:** Has diagnostic markers → Go to Step 4
**NO:** Cannot validate species
→ Might be population structure, not species-level divergence.
Why this matters?
Diagnostic markers form the foundation for your PCR assays and barcodes.

**Step 4 — Is the clade consistent with morphology?**
(Only supportive; not required.)

-	Does morphology support separation?
-	Does morphology contradict genomics?
-	Is morphology ambiguous or plastic?

**YES:** Morphology supports → Strong species case

**NO:** Morphology ambiguous → Still acceptable
CONTRADICTS:
→ Re-examine identifications; may indicate historical lumping or cryptic species.
Why this matters?
Genomics is primary; morphology is secondary verification.

**Step 5 — Is there biogeographic or ecological coherence?**
(Check for plausibility, not necessity.)
-	Geographic clustering
-	Habitat specialization
-	Depth stratification
-	Known biogeographic barriers

**YES:** Adds confidence → Proceed to species designation
**NO:** Still acceptable but interpret cautiously
Why this matters?
Biogeography helps confirm real evolutionary structure.

**Final Decision Rule**

A lineage is considered a species if:
1.	Nuclear genomic data form a strong monophyletic clade, consistently across UCE and exon datasets.
2.	Mitochondrial data do not contradict nuclear topology (supportive or neutral).
3.	Diagnostic SNPs or loci are present that uniquely define the lineage.
4.	Morphology does not refute genomic evidence (agreement = stronger case; disagreement = investigate).
5.	Biogeographic/ecological signals are consistent (optional but helpful).
If all conditions 1–3 are met, → Species-level lineage confirmed.
Conditions 4–5 = supporting evidence.
